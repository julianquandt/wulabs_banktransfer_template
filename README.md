# Description

This repository contains a SoSciSurvey template to collect payout of participants from your study.
The survey can be referred to from your study (from e.g. an oTree, Qualtrics or Psychopy Study) to safely assess payout data seperately from the experimental data.
This repository contains two files, an English version of the payout template (`wulabs_bank_transfer_template_eng.xml`), and a German version (`wulabs_bank_transfer_template_ger.xml`). 
The two files are identical except for the language, so choose the one that matches the language of your experiment.

# Usage
